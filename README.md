### Autoencoder Deep Learning Models 

This repository contains various Autoencoder model arhcitectures for compressing data from a higher to a lower dimension taking time series data input.
The models are based on:
- Fully connected layers
- 1D convolution layers along the temporal dimension
- 2D convolution utilizing both temporal and spatial dimensions.
- LSTM based autoecoder model initially utilizing 1D convolution layers for feature extraction.
- Transformer based autoecoders model
